# ⚖️ Axiom Subnet Design Proposal

## The Truth Layer for AI Agents

### Built on Bittensor

---

# 1. Overview


**Axiom is a decentralized arbitration subnet where AI agents resolve disputes through reproducible proofs, and miners earn TAO by demonstrating verifiable correctness while validators objectively score them.**

---

## Vision

As AI agents become autonomous economic actors, they increasingly:

* generate outputs
* execute tasks
* make predictions
* interact with other agents
* transact value

When these agents disagree about correctness, there is currently no trustless way to determine truth.

Axiom provides:

👉 **Decentralized, programmatic arbitration for machine intelligence**

It turns **truth verification and reasoning into an incentivized digital commodity**.

---

---

# 2. Problem Statement

Today, AI systems rely on:

* centralized moderation
* manual audits
* trusted intermediaries

These approaches are:

❌ subjective
❌ slow
❌ expensive
❌ non-scalable
❌ not trustless

As machine-to-machine economies grow, automated arbitration becomes essential.

Without a decentralized truth layer:

* models hallucinate unchecked
* bots cheat or misreport
* outputs cannot be verified
* trust breaks down

---

---

# 3. Solution - Axiom

Axiom converts disputes into **deterministic, testable tasks**.

Instead of asking:

❌ “Who argued better?”

It asks:

✅ “Which solution can be verified programmatically?”

Miners compete to produce correct, reproducible judgments.
Validators execute evaluation scripts to score them.
TAO emissions reward truth.

---

---

# 4. Digital Commodity

## Verified Judgments

Each task produces:

* verdict
* reasoning
* reproducible proof

This is pure **intelligence work**, not compute or storage.

It directly represents:

👉 reasoning
👉 verification
👉 correctness

Which aligns natively with Bittensor’s incentive model.

---

---

# 5. Incentive & Mechanism Design

## Core Principle

### ❌ No subjective judging

### ✅ Only executable proofs

All disputes must be:

* deterministic
* reproducible
* automatically testable

If a task cannot be evaluated programmatically, it is not accepted.

---

## Emission & Reward Logic

Each miner submission receives a score:

```
score =
0.6 correctness
+ 0.2 proof validity
+ 0.1 latency
+ 0.1 confidence calibration
```

### Distribution

* Higher score → higher emissions
* Lower score → minimal reward
* Persistently low → deregistration

Validators earn dividends for accurate, active evaluation.

---

---

## Incentive Alignment

### Miners

Maximize:

* correctness
* reproducibility
* speed

Because:

* truth → profit
* incorrect → zero

---

### Validators

Maximize:

* honest scoring
* uptime
* objective evaluation

Because:

* emissions tied to trust

---

### Result

The most profitable strategy for all actors is to behave honestly and intelligently.

---

---

## Anti-Adversarial Mechanisms

Axiom discourages low-quality behavior through:

1. Mandatory proof submission
2. Deterministic evaluation scripts
3. Stake-backed confidence penalties
4. Multiple validator consensus
5. Randomized tasks
6. Emission pruning

Spam and guessing are economically irrational.

---

---

## Proof of Intelligence

Axiom qualifies as **Proof of Intelligence** because miners must:

* analyze evidence
* reason about correctness
* reproduce outcomes
* provide verifiable proofs

There are no shortcuts.

Only demonstrable intelligence generates emissions.

---

---

## High-Level Algorithm

### Step 1 - Task creation

Dispute converted into evaluation script

### Step 2 - Broadcast

Task sent to all miners

### Step 3 - Submission

Miners return:

* verdict
* proof
* metadata

### Step 4 - Validation

Validators execute script

### Step 5 - Scoring

Scores computed

### Step 6 - Weight update

Validators set weights

### Step 7 - Emissions

Rewards distributed

---

---

# 6. Miner Design

## Role

Miners act as solver/advocate agents.

They compete to determine correct outcomes.

---

## Tasks

Examples:

* run unit tests on code
* replay logs
* compute prediction error
* verify factual correctness
* validate execution traces

---

## Input → Output

### Input

```
task_id
task_type
evidence
evaluation_script
constraints
```

### Output

```
verdict
proof
reasoning
confidence
latency
```

---

## Performance Dimensions

Miners ranked by:

* correctness
* proof validity
* speed
* calibration

---

---

# 7. Validator Design

## Role

Validators act as judges.

They do not solve problems.

They only:

👉 execute evaluation scripts

---

## Scoring Methodology

* run deterministic tests
* verify proofs
* compute score
* assign weights

No subjective decisions.

---

## Evaluation Cadence

* tasks per epoch
* continuous scoring
* periodic weight updates

Ensures constant competition.

---

## Validator Incentives

Validators earn:

* emissions
* dividends

Only if:

* online
* accurate
* active

Dishonest validators lose ranking.

---

---

# 8. Business Logic & Market Rationale

## Why this matters

AI systems increasingly make economic decisions.

Trust and verification are becoming infrastructure needs.

Axiom provides:

👉 decentralized arbitration-as-a-service

---

## Target Use Cases

### Immediate

* model benchmarking
* hallucination detection
* code correctness

### Mid-term

* DAO governance disputes
* smart contract verification
* cross-subnet arbitration

### Long-term

* autonomous agent economies

---

## Competition

### Inside Bittensor

Inference/compute subnets
No arbitration layer

### Outside

Centralized audits
Manual reviews

All lack decentralization and incentives.

---

## Why Bittensor

Bittensor already provides:

* miners
* validators
* emissions

Axiom naturally maps onto this structure.

It is an architectural fit, not an add-on.

---

## Path to Adoption

### Phase 1

Synthetic tasks

### Phase 2

Integration with other subnets

### Phase 3

Public API

### Phase 4

Default arbitration layer

---

---

# 9. Go-To-Market Strategy

## Initial Users

* AI evaluation tools
* inference subnets
* model providers
* DAO systems

---

## Distribution

* open-source SDK
* subnet partnerships
* developer integrations

---

## Bootstrapping Incentives

### Miners

boosted early emissions

### Validators

early dividends

### Users

free early dispute resolution

---

---

# 10. Conclusion

**Axiom transforms truth into an economic commodity.**

Miners compete to prove correctness.
Validators verify objectively.
Emissions reward intelligence.

It provides the trust infrastructure required for decentralized AI economies.

🔥 Done.
This is a **complete, submission-ready subnet proposal**.

Next we should:
👉 create pitch deck slides
👉 or architecture diagrams
👉 or write the explanation video script
